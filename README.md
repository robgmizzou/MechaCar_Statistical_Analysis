# MechaCar Prototyping


## Linear Regression to Predict MPG
Using multiple vehicle metrics, we have attempted to isolate factors most impactful to the performance of the MechaCar prototypes.<br>
Vehicle length and ground clearance had statistically significant impacts on Miles per Gallon (MPG) performance.<br>
The p-value for this model is 5.35e-11, meaning the null must be rejected and the test is statistically significant.  The relationship between our variables and MPG is not random chance.<br>
Despite the small number of variables considered, this model did a reasonable job predicting MPG of MechaCar prototypes.  The R-Squared value of 71% indicate high relative prediction accuracy.<br>

## Summary Statistics on Suspension Coils

Address the prompt "The design specifications for the MechaCar suspension coils dictate that the variance of the suspension coils must not exceed 100 pounds per square inch. Does the current manufacturing data meet this design specification for all manufacturing lots in total and each lot individually? Why or why not?"<br>
